This constraint is commonly known as the blockchain trilemma, where decentralization, security, and scalability counteract each other. Although Cardano employs an efficient consensus algorithm, its global distribution among thousands of block-producing nodes results in block creation approximately every twenty seconds. During peak transaction times, this can lead to increased settlement times as transactions may not be included in the immediate next block.","sidebar":"developerDocumentation"},"dev/specification":{"id":"dev/specification","title":"Specification","description":"The specification is currently written in LaTeX and can be edited in the hydra-formal-specification repository.
